D-Portal
====================

This is a project to build a re-usable piece of code that can be 
easily hosted by anyone, anywhere and that will tell an interesting 
story using IATI data.

As it stands, you can view the development version at
http://dev.d-portal.org/

The live version lives at
http://d-portal.org/

Please remember that this is a work in progress so it may break or
change at any moment.
